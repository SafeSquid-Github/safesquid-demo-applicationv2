# Setup Guide for SSL Certificates, Apache, and Bind9 DNS

## Description

This script automates the process of setting up SSL certificates for multiple hostnames, configuring Apache as a reverse proxy for each hostname, and setting up a Bind9 DNS server. It also installs necessary dependencies and creates the necessary directories and files.

The script includes the following main steps:

1. Install dependencies (Apache, Bind9, SQLite, OpenSSL, Node.js, PM2, etc.)
2. Create directories and set appropriate permissions.
3. Generate a Root Certificate Authority (Root CA) if one does not exist.
4. Generate SSL certificates for multiple hostnames (wildcard certificates included).
5. Set up Apache configuration files for each hostname.
6. Set up Bind9 DNS records for each hostname with dynamic IP address resolution.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that you have:

- A Linux server (Ubuntu/Debian-based recommended).
- Root or sudo privileges to install packages and modify system configurations.
- Node.js and NPM installed if you want to use PM2 for process management.
- A working DNS setup for your server.

## Installation

### 1. Clone or Download the Script

Clone or download this repository to your server.

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

### 2. Make the Script Executable

Ensure the script has executable permissions. You can set the permissions by running the following command:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```

### 3. Edit Configuration (Optional)

You may need to customize the script before running it. For example:

- Modify the `HOSTS` variable with the desired hostnames and their ports.
- Set the directory paths if you have custom locations for your certificates and logs.

### 4. Run the Setup Script

Run the script as root or using `sudo`:

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh
```

This will execute the script and automatically perform the necessary steps to set up SSL certificates, configure Apache, and set up Bind9 DNS.

## Script Breakdown

### 1. **Dependencies Installation** (`INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES`)
   - Updates the package list and installs the required software: Bind9, Monit, SQLite3, Apache2, OpenSSL, Node.js, npm, jq, and PM2.
   - Enables Apache SSL and other necessary modules.

### 2. **Directory Creation and Permissions Setup** (`CREATE_FOLDERS_AND_PERMISSIONS`)
   - Creates necessary directories for SQLite, Bind9 zones, and logs.
   - Sets appropriate ownership and permissions for the directories.

### 3. **Root Certificate Authority Creation** (`CREATE_ROOT_CA`)
   - Creates a self-signed Root Certificate Authority (Root CA) if one does not already exist.
   - Generates a private key and certificate for the Root CA.

### 4. **Certificate Verification and Generation** (`VERIFY_CERTIFICATE_WITH_ROOT_CA`, `GENERATE_CERTIFICATES_FOR_HOSTNAMES`)
   - Verifies the SSL certificates for each hostname and regenerates them if they are expired or invalid.
   - Uses the Root CA to sign the certificates.

### 5. **Apache VirtualHost Configuration** (`GENERATE_APACHE_CONF`)
   - Configures Apache to use SSL certificates for each hostname.
   - Sets up a reverse proxy for each hostname to route traffic to the appropriate ports.
   - Ensures HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS.

### 6. **Bind9 DNS Configuration** (`SETUP_BIND9_DNS`)
   - Sets up Bind9 to manage DNS records for each hostname.
   - Creates zone files and configures Bind9 to resolve hostnames to the server's IP address.
   - Adds DNS logging configuration.

### 7. **Starting PM2 and Saving the Configuration** (`MAIN`)
   - Starts your application using PM2 and watches for any changes in the specified `ecosystem.config.js` file.

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission Errors:** Ensure you are running the script with root or sudo privileges.
- **Certificate Generation Failed:** If SSL certificate generation fails, check the permissions on the certificate directories or check the OpenSSL commands for errors.
- **Bind9 DNS Issues:** Verify that the Bind9 service is running and that the DNS zone files are correctly created.
  
You can view the logs for Bind9 at `/var/log/named/query.log` for more details on DNS resolution.
